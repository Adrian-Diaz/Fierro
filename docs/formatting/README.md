# Formatting

Fierro uses [Uncrustify](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify/tree/master) to standardize the syle and clean up code. Currently, code formatting is not
strictly enforced, but that is the current direction. The Uncrustify [GitHub](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify/tree/master) page has extensive
documentation for building and running Uncrustify. The supplied uncrustify.cfg file should be used when formatting with Uncrustify.

A future goal is to automate this process during a push.
